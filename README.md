# Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello! I’m Yasna Rahmani, a third-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Political Economy and minoring in Data Science.

Broadly, I am interested in researching and addressing the economic systems, government policies, and societal structures that create and sustain disparities in wealth, power, and opportunity. More specifically, I focus on policy work related to housing, poverty, and education.

I’m fascinated by the power of data science and how it can be leveraged to better understand and address society's most pressing issues.

This portfolio showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I’ve completed both independently and as part of my coursework. I plan to continue adding new projects as I progress through my studies and data science journey.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the projects I’ve completed:
