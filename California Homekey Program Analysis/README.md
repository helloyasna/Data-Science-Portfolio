## California Homekey Program Analysis üè†
In response to California's escalating housing crisis and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, California legislators implemented the Homekey Program, a statewide initiative providing grants to convert buildings into affordable housing for people experiencing homelessness. Launched in 2020, the program has granted funding through three rounds to date.

This project utilizes data from the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). By combining funding data, point-in-time (PIT) estimates, and geographic information, I created several visualizations to explore:

- The distribution of Homekey award funding by county
- The distribution of unhoused people (as per PIT estimates) by county
- Temporal trends of homelessness in counties with the lowest Round 2 Homekey funding
- Temporal trends of homelessness in counties with the highest Round 2 Homekey funding
- The relationship between award timing and total awards
- The relationship between award intensity and homelessness count
  
These visualizations are included as PNG files.
The accompanying Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory analysis processes.
